  This module represents the analyses included with jamovi. It contains many
  common analyses (such as t-tests, ANOVAs, regression, correlation matrices,
  proportion tests, contingency tables, factor analysis, etc).

  - title: Descriptives

  - title: Independent Samples T-Test
    name: ttestIS
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: T-Tests
    menuTitle: Independent Samples T-Test
    description: |
      The Student's Independent samples t-test (sometimes called a two-samples
      t-test) is used to test the null hypothesis that two groups have the
      same mean. A low p-value suggests that the null hypothesis is not true,
      and therefore the group means are different.

      The Student's independent t-test assumes that the data from each group
      are from a normal distribution, and that the variances of these groups
      are equal. If unwilling to assume the groups have equal variances, the
      Welch's t-test can be used in it's place. If one is additionally
      unwilling to assume the data from each group are from a normal
      distribution, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test can be used instead
      (However, note that the Mann-Whitney U test has a slightly different
      null hypothesis; that the distributions of each group is equal).

    menuGroup: T-Tests
    menuTitle: Paired Samples T-Test
    description: |
      The Student's paired samples t-test (sometimes called a
      dependent-samples t-test) is used to test the null hypothesis that the
      difference between pairs of measurements is equal to zero. A low p-value
      suggests that the null hypothesis is not true, and that the
      difference between the measurement pairs is not zero.

      The Student's paired samples t-test assumes that pair differences follow
      a normal distribution -- in the case that one is unwilling to assume
      this, the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank can be used in it's place
      (However, note that the Wilcoxon signed-rank has a slightly different
      null hypothesis; that the two groups of measurements follow the same
      distribution).
  - title: One Sample T-Test

    menuGroup: T-Tests
    menuTitle: One Sample T-Test
    description: |
      The Student's One-sample t-test is used to test the null hypothesis that
      the true mean is equal to a particular value (typically zero). A low
      p-value suggests that the null hypothesis is not true, and therefore
      the true mean must be different from the test value.

      The Student's One-sample t-test assumes that the data are from a normal
      distribution -- in the case that one is unwilling to assume this, the
      non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank can be used in it's place (However,
      note that the Wilcoxon signed-rank has a slightly different null
      hypothesis; that the *median* is equal to the test value).

    menuTitle: Correlation Matrix
    ns: jmv
    description: |
      Correlation matrices are a way to examine linear relationships between
      two or more continuous variables.

      For each pair of variables, a Pearson's r value indicates the strength
      and direction of the relationship between those two variables. A
      positive value indicates a positive relationship (higher values of one
      variable predict higher values of the other variable). A negative
      Pearson's r indicates a negative relationship (higher values of one
      variable predict lower values of the other variable, and vice-versa).
      A value of zero indicates no relationship (whether a variable is high
      or low, does not tell us anything about the value of the other
      variable).

      More formally, it is possible to test the null hypothesis that the
      correlation is zero using and calculate a p-value. If the p-value is
      low, it suggests the correlation co-efficient is not zero, and there is
      a linear (or more complex) relationship between the two variables.
