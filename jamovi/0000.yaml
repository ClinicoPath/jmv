  This module represents the analyses included with jamovi. It contains many
  common analyses (such as t-tests, ANOVAs, regression, correlation matrices,
  proportion tests, contingency tables, factor analysis, etc).
analyses:
  - title: Descriptives
    name: descriptives
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: Exploration
    menuTitle: Descriptives
    description: Provides a range of descriptive statistics
  - title: Independent Samples T-Test
    name: ttestIS
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: T-Tests
    menuTitle: Independent Samples T-Test
    description: |-
      The Student's Independent samples t-test (sometimes called a two-samples
      t-test) is used to test the null hypothesis that two groups have the
      same mean. A low p-value suggests that the null hypothesis is not true,
      and therefore the group means are different.
  - title: Paired Samples T-Test
    name: ttestPS
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: T-Tests
    menuTitle: Paired Samples T-Test
    description: |-
      The Student's paired samples t-test (sometimes called a
      dependent-samples t-test) is used to test the null hypothesis that the
      difference between pairs of measurements is equal to zero. A low p-value
      suggests that the null hypothesis is not true, and that the
      difference between the measurement pairs is not zero.
  - title: One Sample T-Test
    name: ttestOneS
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: T-Tests
    menuTitle: One Sample T-Test
    description: |-
      The Student's One-sample t-test is used to test the null hypothesis that
      the true mean is equal to a particular value (typically zero). A low
      p-value suggests that the null hypothesis is not true, and therefore
      the true mean must be different from the test value.
  - title: One-Way ANOVA
    name: anovaOneW
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuTitle: One-Way ANOVA
    description: |-
      The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable, and one or more categorical
      explanatory variables. This 'One-Way ANOVA' is a simplified version of
      the 'normal' ANOVA, allowing only a single explanatory factor, however
      also providing a Welch's ANOVA. The Welch's ANOVA has the advantage that
      it need not assume that the variances of all groups are equal.
  - title: ANOVA
    name: anova
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuTitle: ANOVA
    description: |-
      The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable, and one or more categorical
      explanatory variables.
  - title: Repeated Measures ANOVA
    name: anovaRM
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuTitle: Repeated Measures ANOVA
    description: |-
      The Repeated Measures ANOVA is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable and one or more categorical
      explanatory variables, where one or more of the explanatory variables
      are 'within subjects' (where multiple measurements are from the same
      subject). Additionally, this analysis allows the inclusion of
      covariates, allowing for repeated measures ANCOVAs as well.
  - title: ANCOVA
    name: ancova
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuTitle: ANCOVA
    description: |
      The Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable, one or more categorical
      explanatory variables, and one or more continuous explanatory variables
      (or covariates). It is essentially the same analysis as ANOVA, but
      with the addition of covariates.
  - title: MANCOVA
    name: mancova
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuTitle: MANCOVA

      two or more continuous variables.
