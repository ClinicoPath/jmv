        The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to explore the relationship
        between a continuous dependent variable, and one or more categorical
        explanatory variables. This 'One-Way ANOVA' is a simplified version of
        the 'normal' ANOVA, allowing only a single explanatory factor, however
        also providing a Welch's ANOVA. The Welch's ANOVA has the advantage that
        it need not assume that the variances of all groups are equal.

        For convenience, this method allows specifying multiple dependent
        variables, resulting in multiple independent tests.

        Note that the Welch's ANOVA is the same procedure as the Welch's
        independent samples t-test.
